1:Transformations: --> In CSS, we have a bunch of functions for transforming elements:
    (1): rotate(): for rotating elements
    (2): scale(): for make them larger or smaller
    (3): skew(): for screwing them to the left or to the right
    (4): translate(): for positioning them in the screen
