    <!-- If we wanna build a content form with two fields.  -->
 <form action="http://formspree.io/f/myybnlqn" method="POST">
     <input type="text" placeholder="Name" name="name"></form>
     <input type="text" placeholder="Email" name="email"></form>
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     <!-- There is another way to build a submit button: -->
     <!-- <input type="submit" value="Submit"> -->
     <!-- The difference of these two approaches: we can not add a icon with input element, we have to use button element, because in
        between the opening and closing tags, we can type HTML codes. -->

    <!-- For submitting the form, there are two attributes in the form element we need to know:
        (1): action: this is where we are going to send the data, so here we have to type relative or absolute url, but what is 
            behind the url? this is server-side technologies. And go to formspree.io, and create a new form called contact form,
            copy the url and place it inside the action attribute. 
        (2): method: to submit the form, each input field should have a name attribute, so add the name attribute in these two
            input fields. Then type something and submit the form.
        (3): All in all, the action is where you are sending the data, the method which is how we are sending the data.
            And with the POST method, when we use this method, these fields like name and email, and their values will be included 
            in the body of the request. And with the GET method, these fields will not be included in the body of the request, 
            instead they will be appended to the target url. When we should use the GET method, this is used in the situation
            where you wanna bookmark the url, so we can always get back to it, this is the benefit of the GET method.-->
        
    <!-- server-side technologies:
        (1): Node/Express
        (2): Django
        (3): ASP.NET
        (4): Laravel
        (5): Ruby on Rails -->
