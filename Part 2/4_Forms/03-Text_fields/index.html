        placeholder: when we do not type anything, we will see the placeholder, but when we begin to type something, the placeholder will disappear.
        read-only: we can not change the value of the input field.
        disable: we can not select the input filed, but the value can be sent to the server. 
        maxlength: this is use for validation.
        Autofocus: this is a boolean attribute, we do not have to give it a value and when we go to the page, the first input filed automatically get
            focus, this is particular useful for logging or registration forms, because we do not wanna the users explicitly click the 
            first input filed to activate it.
