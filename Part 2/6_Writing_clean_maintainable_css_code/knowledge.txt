1: What we will learn?
    (1): CSS best practice
    (2): CSS Variables: for removing duplication in code
    (3): object-oriented CSS: helps us extract reuseable building blocks
    (4): BEM: the popular naming convention for CSS classes

2: Best Practices:
    (1): Follow a nam convention
        Kebab case: we separate multiple words using "-"  --> nav-bar
        Camel case: the first letter of the first word should be lowercase, but the first letter of every word after should be uppercase.
            --> navBar
        Pascal case: the first letter of every word should be uppercase.  --> NavBar
        Another convention: we separate multiple words using an underscore   --> nav_bar

    (2): Create logical sections in your stylesheet.

        /* Basic styles */
        * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        }

        html {
        }

        /* Typography */
        h1, h2, h3, h4 {

        }

        /* Forms */

        /* Navigation bar */

        From the example, we adding these comments help us logically separate different sections in our stylesheet.


    (3): Avoid over-specific selectors:
        Like: div.nav > ul.items > li {}  --> this kind of over-specific selectors are really hard to maintain.
            How can we solve this problem? Remove the ">" and the type of the html element, and give the list element a class
             called item, and the second selector is unnecessary.


    (4): Avoid !important

    (5): Sort CSS properties
        For example:

        .nav-item {
            background: red;
            color: aliceblue;
            font-weight: bold;
            width: 100%;
            /* We can select all these properties and press Ctrl+Shift+p and search for Sort Lines Ascending, then we can sort these properties. */
        }


    (6): Take advantage of style inheritance

    (7): Extract repetitive patterns

    (8): Avoid repetitive values (Keep it DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)



2: Object-oriented CSS:
    (1): Separate container and content 
    (2): Separate structure and skin


3: BEM (Block Element Modifier):
     We use "--" to separate a block from a modifier and we use "__" to separate a block from a element.
