    <!-- But if we do not use the source set, both of these two images are 400 x 400, that is coming from the CSS rule. But on the 
          left side, we have an image that is 400 x 400, the right image is 800 x 800, it means the image on the right is sharper.
          So use the source attribute, we can provide high quality version of our images for high-density screens. -->
