    <!-- If we change the width of this image to 100vm, we will get a problem. Because in our currently implementation, we are
        going to provide the same image to all the devices you saw in the previous line. All these devices have a pixels rato of 2x,
        so we provide the same image which is 800 x 800 to all these devices. But the browser has to resize the image, so we takes
        up 100% of the width of the viewport, now this resizing operation can be costed to the browser, the larger in this image, the 
        more costly this operation is going to be. Because the browser has to load the international memory in order to resize it.
        So this is the resolution switching problem. So we wanna provide different versions of the same image for different sizes
        for different resolution.
    
        What we can do is to provide the image with three different sizes like small, medium and large, and let the browser pick 
        up the best image based on the screen resolution and pixels ratio of the device. 
    
        So we have to change the code:
    -->
    <img
      src="..//images/meal.jpg"
      alt="A bowl of delicious food"
      class="meal"
      srcset="
        ..//images/meal.jpg     400w,
        ..//images/meal@2x.jpg  800w,
        ..//images/meal@3.jpg  1200w
      "
    />

    <!-- So now our browser knows the width of the image and it can pick up the right image depending on the resolution and
        pixel ratio of the screen. -->
